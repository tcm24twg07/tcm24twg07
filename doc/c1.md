# C1 : Cinematic Destinations - Film Tourism Website

## Description
The specific theme of the work will be “Cinematic destinations”, where we will
show the different well-known and not so famous tourist locations that have
been used in the world of cinema to film the works that we see behind the
screen, both series and films.
The website will be divided into different sections (subject to some changes) that
the user will be able to visit, such as:
1. Home
This page will introduce the visitor into the theme of film tourism and give
some examples about it. It will show an index with the information that can
be found on the website and some images that attract the viewer's attention.
2. Films, series and their locations
Here a list will be shown with some cinematographic works and the spaces
used for their recording. It is also possible to add specific routes for some
very well-known works within film tourism, such as “Game of Thrones”.
Thanks to this, travelers will be able to visit not only one, but several nearby
locations that follow the same theme. Each work will contain images from
both the series and “real life” to observe both their contrast and their
similarities.
Some recommendations about the sites will also be added, such as which
season to visit or the best our to visit it.
3. Curiosities
Here we will show some curiosities about the works shown on the page
related to the locations and the impact that these works have had on the
chosen destinations.
4. Our favorites
Here we will show some of the favourite destinations of the creators and the
public, showing the most famous and beloved locations by cinephiles.
