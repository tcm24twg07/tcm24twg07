2. **Movies & Locations** - Searchable database of filming locations
3. **Curiosities** - Behind-the-scenes information and facts
4. **Our Favourites** - Highlighted locations and recommendations

Each section is designed to be easily accessible regardless of device size, with navigation patterns optimized for both touch and cursor interactions.
