                        <p>The iconic "One Ring" prop was made using a real gold ring, which was surprisingly heavy and uncomfortable to wear for the actors during long takes.</p>

                        <p>The battle sequences were so complex that special "choreographed" stunts were developed to make the large-scale action look more fluid and natural, with some actors performing their own stunts.</p>

                        <p>The giant "Argonath" statues seen in The Two Towers were actually massive sculptures created as part of the set. They were so large that it took hundreds of crew members to move them into position for the shots.</p>

                        <img src="../doc/images/dance_lll.jpg" alt="A lovely night performance from La La Land">
                        <p>One of the film's most iconic dance sequences was filmed atop the Hollywood Hills during magic hour, a brief period when the sun sets or rises, creating a soft, glowing sky. Director Chazelle chose this timing to enhance the visual impact of the choreography, making the scene truly spectacular.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="movie-location">
                        <img src="../doc/images/cars_lll.jpg" alt="Another Day of Sun performance from La La Land">
                        <p>*La La Land* opens with the energetic song "Another Day of Sun," featuring a vibrant dance number in the middle of a freeway. Instead of using a green screen, the filmmakers chose to film on location, shutting down a section of the freeway to capture the authentic chaos and energy of the scene.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="movie-location">
                        <img src="../doc/images/piano_lll.jpg" alt="Ryan Gosling playing piano in La La Land">
                        <p>In *La La Land*, instead of relying on post-production sound or a double for close-ups, Ryan Gosling learned to play jazz piano for his role. This dedication added authenticity to his performance, as he played the piano himself in many of the film's musical scenes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="movie-location">

                        <p>Chazelle chose to record many songs live to capture the raw emotion and subtle details. This paid off, as Emma Stone's "Audition" was nominated for a Critics' Choice Award, and her duet with Ryan Gosling, "City of Stars," won the top prize.</p>

                        <p>The famous train was not a CGI creation. Filming took place on the actual Jacobite Steam Train in Scotland, which travels through the stunning Scottish Highlands, making it the perfect backdrop for the magical journey to Hogwarts.</p>

                        <p>Daniel Radcliffe wore more than 160 pairs of glasses throughout the series. The design was adjusted slightly over time to ensure they fit his character and were practical for long shoots.

                        <p> The Sorting Hat was an intricate puppet controlled by a team of puppeteers. Its design was based on J.K. Rowling’s description, with the voice performed by actor and director, Leslie Phillips.</p>

                        <p>The thrilling opening chase scene, where Bond is pursued on rooftops in Istanbul, took several months to plan and rehearse. The team used real locations and complex stunts, avoiding CGI to make it as authentic as possible.</p>

                        <p>Javier Bardem, who played the villain Silva, had a memorable scene where he bleached his hair for the role. He chose to speak in a creepy, soft voice to create an unsettling presence, which became one of the most iconic villain performances in the series.</p>

                        <p>The iconic Aston Martin DB5, which appeared in Skyfall, was restored for the film. The car had not been used since GoldenEye (1995), and the production team went to great lengths to bring it back in perfect condition for the action scenes.</p>

                        <p>The dramatic scenes set in Scotland were filmed at the real location of the Bond family home, Skyfall Lodge. The isolated location added authenticity and breathtaking views, but also posed challenges for the crew due to the harsh weather conditions.</p>

                        <p>Meryl Streep performed all of her own singing in the movie. She worked with a vocal coach to prepare and recorded her musical numbers live on set to maintain authenticity.</p>

                        <p>Pierce Brosnan’s singing was a surprise to many fans. Although he’s not known for his singing abilities, Brosnan was encouraged to perform his own vocals for his role as Sam. His rendition of “S.O.S.” was famously considered imperfect, but it became a charming and memorable moment in the film.</p>

                        <p>Amanda Seyfried, who played Sophie, was initially nervous about singing in front of such a talented cast. Her audition was so impressive, however, that she quickly won the role.</p>

                        <p>The iconic Iron Throne was made up of over 2000 swords welded together, but it was not comfortable to sit on. In fact, the chair was so sharp that actors had to be cautious, with many of them actually getting cut during filming.</p>

                        <p>The dragons in Game of Thrones were created using a combination of CGI and practical effects.

                        <p>The infamous Red Wedding scene was filmed in a real medieval castle in Northern Ireland, and the cast was kept in the dark about the shocking deaths. The actors didn’t know what was going to happen until it was time to film their final moments, making their reactions genuine.</p>

                        <p>The Demogorgon, the terrifying creature from the Upside Down, was designed using a combination of practical effects, animatronics, and CGI. The creature’s flower-like mouth was inspired by real-world plants, creating a chilling and unique monster.</p>

                        <p>Millie Bobby Brown shaved her head for the first season of Stranger Things to portray Eleven’s escape from the lab. The transformation was intense, but she said it was a liberating experience, and her iconic buzzcut became a major part of her character’s identity.</p>

                        <p>The show’s creators, the Duffer Brothers, drew heavily from 80s pop culture when creating Stranger Things. The music, fashion, and even the font used for the show's title were inspired by films, TV shows, and video games from that era, like The Goonies, E.T., and Stephen King novels.</p>

                        <p>The RV used by Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad was a real working RV, not a prop. The production team bought an old 1986 Fleetwood Bounder for just $1,000 and renovated it for the show, making it a key part of the series' visual identity.</p>

                        <p>Bryan Cranston’s transformation into Walter White’s alter ego, Heisenberg, was complete with the iconic hat. The hat was initially a small prop, but as the character grew darker, the hat became a symbol of his transformation, representing his new, ruthless persona.</p>

                        <p>The use of color was highly intentional in Breaking Bad. Costume designer Kathleen Detoro and the creators used specific colors to symbolize character arcs. For example, Walter White often wore green, symbolizing money and growth, while Jesse wore red, representing danger and emotional turmoil.</p>

                        <p>The iconic scene of Walter White throwing a pizza onto the roof was unplanned. Bryan Cranston, frustrated with the scene, tossed it, and it landed perfectly. The shot was so good that they kept it in the show.</p>

                        <p>The opening scene of each season was filmed in the hotel lobby, but it was a challenge because it had to be shot at different times of day for various lighting effects. This led to some interesting scheduling challenges for the crew.</p>

                        <p>The opening murder mystery in the first season was filmed with careful attention to detail. To maintain secrecy about the plot, the identity of the murderer and the victim were kept a secret, even from some of the actors until the final episodes were shot.</p>

                        <p>Filming The White Lotus during the COVID-19 pandemic meant the crew had to adhere to strict safety protocols. The cast and crew were tested regularly, and special care was taken to create a safe working environment, especially in shared spaces like the resort's common areas.</p>

                        <p>The stunning sunsets featured throughout the show were an important part of the visuals. The crew took advantage of the golden hour (just before sunset) to capture the perfect lighting for the outdoor scenes, which added to the luxurious, cinematic feel of the series.</p>

                        <p>The extravagant sets in Bridgerton, especially the interiors of the Bridgerton family home, were created with meticulous attention to detail. The designers drew inspiration from Regency-era architecture but added a modern twist, incorporating bold colors and opulent designs that didn’t adhere strictly to historical accuracy.</p>

                        <p>The strikingly colorful Featherington family home was filmed in a real house, but the bright, bold decor was designed specifically for the series. The set designers used a mixture of historical furniture and modern colors to make the house stand out as a symbol of the family’s flamboyant and somewhat ostentatious style.</p>

                        <p>Queen Charlotte’s extravagant wardrobe and jewelry were carefully chosen to highlight her high status and over-the-top personality.
